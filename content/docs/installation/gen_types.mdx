description: Generating a type file from Home Assistant

## About
HA Components includes a script that fetches your entities from Home Assistant and generates types for them.\
The advantages of this is that all entities can be inferred by most ides.

## Step 1: Setup
Create an env variable named `AUTH_TOKEN` and set it to a valid auth token.
You can find how to get a valid long-lived token [here](https://developers.home-assistant.io/docs/auth_api/#long-lived-access-token)

## Step 2: Register in package.json
Add the script into package.json
```json
{
  "scripts": {
    "generate:entities": "tsx scripts/generate_entities.ts",
  },
}
```

## Step 3: Run the script
You can now run the script using the following command
```bash
npm run generate:entities
```
This will create a `types\entity-types.ts` file which contains the generated types

## Misc
If your home assistant entities changes for any reason you can regenerate your entity file by rerunning Step 3
