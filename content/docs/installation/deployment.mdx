## Standard hosting (Recommended)
If you deploy using a node server or via a some other static hosting service, there are no changes needed by HA-Components.


## Home Assistant Hosting

## Step 1: Set up your framework to build statically
<Callout>
  Note: remember to set your `NEXT_HA_REDIRECT_URI || VITE_HA_REDIRECT_URL` env variable path to be `/local/auth/callback/index.html` instead of `/auth/callback/`
</Callout>
<Tabs items={['NEXT.js', 'Vite+Tanstack', 'Tanstack Start']}>
  <Tab value="NEXT.js">    
    To enable static Next.js build, you will need to modify `next.config.js`
    ``` tsx
    /**
    * @type {import('next').NextConfig}
    */
    const nextConfig = {
      output: 'export',
      trailingSlash: true,
      basePath:'/local/'
    }
    
    module.exports = nextConfig
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Vite+Tanstack">
    To enable static Vite builds to path properly, you need to modify `vite.config.ts`
    ```ts
    defineConfig({
      base: "/local"
    })
    ```
    You will also need to modify your Tanstack Router setup to work properly with Home Assistant.
    
    Modify `src\main.tsx` by adding 
    ```tsx
    if (window.location.pathname.endsWith("/index.html")) {
      const newUrl =
        window.location.pathname.replace(/index\.html$/, "") +
        window.location.search +
        window.location.hash;
      window.history.replaceState({}, "", newUrl);
    }
    ```
    before `createRouter` is called, additionally, modify `createRouter` to include `basepath:'/local'`
    ```tsx
    const router = createRouter({
      basepath:'/local'
    });
    ```

    
  </Tab>
  <Tab value="Tanstack Start">
    Currently it is not possible to get a static build that works with Home Assistant with Tanstack Start as it cannot handle SSR.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step 2: Hosting
To make HA host your build, move your build to the the `/homeassistant/www/` path.\
This can be done several ways e.g. ssh, code server. How it is done is left to your descretion.\

## Step 3: Access your Dashboard
You can then access your dashboard by navigating to [http://homeassistant.local:8123/local/index.html](http://homeassistant.local:8123/local/index.html)
