description: A component framework for Home Assistant Dashboards
---

HA Components is a component framework for creating great Home Assistant Dashboards.\
It has a similar pitch to shadcn/ui, instead of a component libraries or Home Assistant where you are bound by the limits of HA's styling, you are given a component and the source code.

HA components are reasonably styled components, but with the full source code.\
You have full control to customise or rework the components for your own needs.

Or if you wish, you can entirely ignore the components given and easily create your components which interact with 
the Home Assistant APIs using the Auth Provider.

## Using the documentation
<Callout>Throughout this documentation, Home Assistant will be referred to as HA</Callout>

I recommend starting with [Installation](/docs/installation/installation), as it should serve as a good foundation.\
From there you can either start integrating components or [creating your own](/docs/advanced/create-your-own).

## Disclaimers
<Callout type="warn">This is BETA software, not everything may work perfectly </Callout>

This is ultimately developed by a single individual, and is still in an experimental state.\
Interfaces may change and things may stop working, though the goal is still to have minimal changes.


## Limitations
This component framework is currently built around NextJS.\
Although I don't see many reasons why it wouldn't work just fine with other frameworks, your milage may vary as they are untested.


## License
All components are MIT Licensed.
