## Overview
HA-Components updates using a rolling release cadence.\
Despite this, it does utilise a fixed versioning system.

Certain major milestones will be marked by a new version number,\
Feature and point changes however will not be marked by a new version number.\
Instead there will be a daily release number created daily, if there were changes made that day.

Versions will be tagged as such:
- `{Version number}-{date}`
